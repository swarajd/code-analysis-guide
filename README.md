# Introduction

**Disclaimer: While this study guide is aimed at VASO's Code Analysis event, it does not take the place of or have the force of the official rules. There is no guarantee that everything that will appear in a Code Analysis test is covered here. Furthermore, the rules of Code Analysis may change in future years, in which case this study guide may become out of date.**

This guide will go over the 2018 rule set for Code Analysis, and explain each concept listed in each bullet and provide examples and practice problems in order to be well prepared for Code Analysis at States, and potentially in future iterations of this event as well. In addition, this guide applies to both division B and division C.
