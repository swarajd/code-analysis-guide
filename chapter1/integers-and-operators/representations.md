# Representations

According to the rules, you should be able to read binary, octal, and hexadecimal constants, so this section will cover how to read those three formats for numbers. We have already been over binary, so this section will focus on octal and hexadecimal.

### Octal

As a review, if we want to write a number in base-10, we write it as multiplications of powers of 10, using the 10 digits \(0-9\). So if we have a number such as 457, it can be represented as the following: $$4*(10^2) + 5*(10^1) + 7*(10^0)$$. If you don't know what an exponent is, that's ok too, you can basically interpret the previous expression as the following:$$4*(10*10) + 5*(10) + 7*(1)$$.

In base-8, or octal, we have each digit be multiplied by a power of 8, and there are only 8 digits \(0-7\). Lets look into how we convert a number such as 19 into octal. 19 in base-10 is represented as the following: $$1*(10^1) + 9*(10^0)$$. Let's see how we'd represent this in base-8. In base-8, the powers of 8 are the following: $$1, 8, 64, 512, 4096, ...$$. So in order to have a number in base-8, it would be represented as the digits 0-7 by powers of 8.
