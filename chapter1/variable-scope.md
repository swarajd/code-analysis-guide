# Variable scope

Honestly this topic is a pain to teach so just read this: [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/variable-scope-in-java/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/variable-scope-in-java/)

This topic is difficult because variable scope almost always results in a compile time error, which we try not to have on tests.
