# Comments

Honestly comments aren't that confusing either. There are like two styles:

```
// comments can be on one line, or

/*
    comments
    can
    be
    on
    multiple
    lines
*/
```

The only thing I can say about this is I guess be warned of code statements inside comments, but that should be self explanatory.
