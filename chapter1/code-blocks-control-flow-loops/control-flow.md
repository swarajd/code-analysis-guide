# Control Flow

In this section, I'll be going over the most common control flow operator: `if/else` . This operator basically executes one section of code, or another, depending on a condition. Let's look some examples below:

```
/// Ex 1.

int b = 5;
int a = 6;

if (a == 6) {
    b = 4;
}

// b == 4



/// Ex 2.

int c = 8;
int d = 2;

if (d == 3) {
    c = 9;
} else {
    c = 0;
}

// c == 0
```
