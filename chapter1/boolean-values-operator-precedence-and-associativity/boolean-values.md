# Boolean Values

In Java, a Boolean value is one with two choices: true or false, yes or no, 1 or 0. Lets look at a few examples of booleans below:

```
boolean a = true;
boolean b = false;
```

Pretty simple, right? There are only two values for booleans, and they're `true` and `false` . However, there's a lot more to booleans to just these two values.
