# Introduction

Hello,

My name is Swaraj Dhumne, and I have been a large part in the writing and Event Supervising of Code Analysis since Virginia Science Olympiad States 2017. You've probably seen me volunteering at the following:

* Fairfax Invitationals 2017
* Fairfax Regionals 2017
* Virginia Tech Invitationals 2017 \(I actually _ran_ this tournament\)
* Fairfax Invitationals 2018
* Charlottesville Regionals 2018
* Fairfax Regionals 2018 \(currently in the future but I will be there\)

I wrote this guide because I've been grading the code analysis test at most events and I've noticed that having a resource to prepare for Code Analysis might be useful. This guide will go over the 2018 rule set for Code Analysis, and explain each concept listed in each bullet and provide examples and practice problems in order to be well prepared for Code Analysis at States, and potentially in future iterations of this event as well. In addition, this guide applies to both division B and division C.

In order to get the full use out of this guide, read everything. I know this book basically reads like a textbook but if you're starting from zero experience, this guide should help you be competitive. If you have computer science experience, feel free to skim some sections, but do read some of the sections on strategy that I write, as they can help you avoid mistakes that you might make during the event.
